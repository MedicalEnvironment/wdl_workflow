# FastQC Quality Control with WDL & Singularity 

Streamline your sequencing data quality control with this easy-to-use WDL (Workflow Description Language) sub-workflow! Powered by FastQC and Singularity containers, you can ensure consistent and reliable QC analysis across different environments.

**Author:** Akbar Abayev, RSU Bioinformatics Group

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Reproducibility:** Singularity containers guarantee that your analysis runs the same way every time, no matter where you execute it.
* **Portability:** Easily share and deploy your QC workflow across various computing platforms.
* **Automation:** Cromwell handles the workflow execution, freeing you from manual intervention.
* **Customization:** Adapt input parameters to fit your specific data and analysis requirements.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

*   **WDL:**
    *   `cromwell-fixed.conf`: Configuration settings for the Cromwell engine.
    *   `fastqc_subworkflow.wdl`: Defines the FastQC workflow steps and logic.
    *   `fastqc_workflow_inputs.json`: Example input parameters to get you started.
*   **fastqc:**
    *   `install_fastqc.sh`: Script to install FastQC.
    *   `run_fastqc.sh`: Script to test your FastQC and Singularity setup.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Prerequisites 

Before diving in, make sure you have the following tools ready:

*   **Singularity:** v3.11.4 or later. Learn more about Singularity: [Introduction to Singularity Containers](https://bioinformaticsworkbook.org/Appendix/HPC/Containers/Intro_Singularity.html#gsc.tab=0)
*   **Java JDK:** v21.0.2 or compatible.
*   **Cromwell:** An open-source workflow management system. 
    *   [Introduction to Cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/FiveMinuteIntro/)
    *   [Cromwell Configuration for Singularity](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/#using-singularity)
*   **Docker:** (Optional) If you want to build your own FastQC image.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Load Modules

```bash
module avail
module load singularity/3.11.4 java/jdk-21.0.2
```

### 2. Pulling and convereting docker image into the singularity format

Pull the respective Docker image from the DockerHub and convert it into a Singularity format (*.sif). In this example, the Docker image is located in a private repository and requires authentication, meaning that you need to provide the appropriate authentication credentials to Singularity. You can use environment variables or Singularity's --docker-login option to provide Docker login credentials. For example:
```bash
export DOCKER_USERNAME=<yourusername>
export DOCKER_PASSWORD=<yourpassword> 
singularity pull --docker-login docker://biocontainers/fastqc:v0.11.9_cv8
```

### 3. FastQC setup and test

1. Navigate to the fastqc directory:
```bash
cd fastqc
```

2. Install FastQC:
```bash
bash install_fastqc.sh
```

3. Test your Setup
```bash
bash run_fastqc.sh
```

### 4. Run the Workflow

1. Navigate to the WDL directory:
```bash
cd ../WDL
```

2. Customize the input parameters in fastqc_workflow_inputs.json. Make sure to provide the correct paths to your input files.

3. Execute the workflow:
```bash
java -Dconfig.file=cromwell-fixed.conf -jar cromwell-87.jar run fastqc_subworkflow.wdl --inputs fastqc_workflow_inputs.json
```

### 5. FastQC Output
The FastQC workflow generates two types of output files:

1. **.zip File:** This is a compressed archive containing basic statistics and quality metrics about the sequence data. It includes files like `fastqc_data.txt` with detailed metrics and `summary.txt` with a quick overview.

2. **.html File:** This is a report file that provides a visual summary of the quality checks, which can be viewed in any web browser.

To unzip the `.zip` file, use the following command in the terminal:
```bash
unzip filename.zip
```
Replace `filename.zip` with the actual name of the `.zip` file.


### What is WDL?

WDL (Workflow Description Language) is a language used to describe data processing workflows. It provides a way to specify tasks and their dependencies in a structured format, making it easier to automate and manage complex data analysis pipelines. WDL is often used with Cromwell, an open-source workflow management system that runs WDL scripts.

### Why Do We Need These Three Files?

1. **cromwell-fixed.conf**
   - **Purpose**: This file contains configuration settings for the Cromwell engine. It includes information such as backend configurations, database settings, and runtime options.
   - **Importance**: Proper configuration ensures that Cromwell can correctly execute workflows using the specified computational resources and settings.

2. **fastqc_subworkflow.wdl**
   - **Purpose**: This is the main WDL script that defines the sub-workflow for running FastQC. It specifies the tasks to be executed, the order in which they should be run, and the inputs/outputs for each task.
   - **Importance**: The WDL file is the core of the workflow, describing the steps and logic of the data processing pipeline. It allows for reproducibility and scalability of the analysis.

3. **fastqc_workflow_inputs.json**
   - **Purpose**: This JSON file provides the input parameters required by the WDL script. It includes paths to input data files, parameter values, and other necessary settings.
   - **Importance**: The inputs file makes the workflow flexible and reusable by allowing users to provide different input values without modifying the WDL script. It separates the workflow logic from the specific data and parameters used in each run.

These three files work together to ensure that the FastQC sub-workflow is properly defined, configured, and executed, providing a robust and reproducible data analysis pipeline.

### ü§î Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, verify the following:

*   **Modules:** Make sure the correct Singularity and Java modules are loaded.
*   **File Paths:** Double-check the paths in your `fastqc_workflow_inputs.json` file.
*   **FastQC:** Ensure FastQC was installed and tested successfully using the `run_fastqc.sh` script.
*   **Cromwell:** Review your Cromwell configuration for any errors.

For further assistance, consult the documentation for:
*   [Cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
*   [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
